    "r: Read mode. This is the default mode. The file is opened for reading, and if the file doesn't exist, an error is raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "w: Write mode. The file is opened for writing, and if the file doesn't exist, a new file is created. If the file already exists, its contents are truncated.\n",
